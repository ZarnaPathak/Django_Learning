                  MVT [Model View Template]

  - **Model**
    It is responsible for defining the structure of your database, including the fields and behaviors of the data you are storing.
  - **Views**
    Views in Django take requests and return responses, typically rendering a template with context data to be displayed to the user.
  - **Template**
     This allows you to embed logic, such as loops and conditionals, directly within your HTML to display data from the model that has been passed to the template by the view.
